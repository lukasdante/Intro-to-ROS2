                Drop the sails, we are going for a ride! 
                <br><br>
                This project aims to teach an introductory course to the <strong>Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2)</strong>. We currently support tutorials and laboratories for the <a href="https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html">Humble Hawksbill</a> distribution. This is an initiative from a small group of young minds that attempted to build something ahead of what seems to be possible - a talking robot arm. We may not be able to disclose the entire source code for the robot that we made because of licensing issues. Anyhow, get ready for a gentle yet cognitively engaging ride! The course design is inspired by <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/">CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</a> by Harvard University which is I deem, by far, the best free massive open online course available for those introductory programming. I hope the university will let us open source this and continue on pursuing robotics in their curriculum when I leave the university. If that happens, I might as well improve or scale this project to a wider range of people. <em>Education should be free for everyone.</em>
                <br><br>
                This initiative is a derivative of an academic paper entitled <strong>Multi-Simulated Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Conversational Robot Arm</strong>. It is an ambitious and student-funded capstone project that aims to build a robot arm that can talk, respond, decide, and move using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms. The robot arm is based on an open-source project called <em>Arctos</em> which uses <em>Controller Area Network (CAN)</em> control for synchronous low-level control. The robot is trained with deep reinforcement learning in <em>4096 massively parallel environments</em> using Isaac Lab and SKRL for a task in reaching a 3D point in space. The robot arm employs cloud computing with <em>Gemini 2.0 Flash</em>, <em>Google ML APIs</em> for text-to-speech and speech-to-text. It also supports edge computing using <em>BakLLaVa (7B)</em> for vision language modelling, <em>Llama 3.2 (1B)</em> for parameter extraction, <em>Kokoro (82M)</em> for text-to-speech, and <em>OpenAI-Whisper</em> (74M) English model for speech-to-text. The researchers used LangChain and Ollama for orchestrating the language models.

                What will you learn in this course? <br><br> This course will cover introductory concepts, demonstrations, and hands-on programming challenges that will kickstart your journey to modern robotics with ROS 2 Humble. Tutorials for newer ROS 2 distributions may be developed. The course outline will be as follows:

                The course contains several modules that are segmented into separate weeks. Each week contains five (5) main parts - Objectives, Concepts, Programming, Deeper Look At Nabi, and Assignment. These sections pertain to:
                <ol>
                    <li>Objectives - objectives of the topic or module.</li>
                    <li>Concepts - concepts or theories behind each topic or module.</li>
                    <li>Programming - hands-on programming exercises for each topic or module.</li>
                    <li>Deeper Look at Nabi - real-life case study and demonstration of the robot arm discussed earlier.</li>
                    <li>Assignment - a programming assignment to be collected in a single repository and committed for each submission. Refer below for further instructions in submitting your assignments.</li>
                </ol>
                Submit your assignments by simply creating a single repository with the name "ROS2-submissions", and clicking the Star in this <a href="https://github.com/lukasdante/Intro-to-ROS2">repository</a>. Make sure the repository you created is public for the assessors to view and check your work. The student/students will be identified by the <code class="inline-code-normal">package.xml</code> file in your workspaces. Assignments will be checked at the end of the semester and be graded fairly by the authors.

                This project wouldn't be possible with the help of the NabiTech team. They are <em>Arianne Joy D. Evangelista</em> who extensively helped in the hardware development, extending sleepless weeks to tirelessly disassemble and rebuild the hardware. <em>Nicamae G. Tamundong</em> who excelled in 3D modelling and built customizations for feasible improvements in the robot arm design. <em>Kyle Mhiron Bumagat</em> who developed multi-shot prompting for the language model parameter extraction using cloud. <em>Althea R. Villanueva</em> who developed the early iterations for computer vision with ROS 2 and OpenCV bridge, and <em>Jhon Mark Remollo</em> who helped in auxiliary tasks. Lastly, the author, <em>John Louis D. Lagramada</em>, who developed the entire software stack and through his ambitions everyone has undeniably seen growth. The entire team spent midnights and mornings to realize what seems to be impossible given the lack of time, money, compute, and mentorship. It is with grit, commitment, and perseverance, that we sailed through.
