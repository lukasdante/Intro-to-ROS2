# Welcome to Introduction to ROS 2!

This project is an open-source repository for teaching an introductory course to the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). We currently support tutorials and laboratories for the Humble Hawksbill distribution. This website is programmed in just a day! Please submit an issue if you found one. This is an initiative from a small group of young minds that attempted to build something ahead of their time i.e a talking robot arm. We may not be able to disclose the entire source code for the robot that we made because of licensing issues. Anyhow, get ready for a gentle yet cognitively engaging ride!

## Contents

What will you learn in this course? This course will cover introductory concepts, demonstrations, and hands-on programming challenges that will kickstart your journey to modern robotics with Robot Operating System 2 Humble Hawksbill distribution. Tutorials for newer ROS 2 distributions may be developed. The course outline will be as follows:

1. Introduction to ROS 2
2. Object-Oriented Programming
3. Nodes, Messages, and Topics
4. Parameters
5. Custom Launch
6. Common ROS 2 Packages
7. Services
8. Actions

The course design is inspired by CS50: Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard which is I deem, by far, the best free MOOC available for those interested in programming. I hope the university will let me open source this and continue on pursuing robotics in their curriculum when I leave the university.
